# ðŸ§  DataFest 2025 â€“ Talent Intelligence Analysis  
**Santander Consumer Global Services Ã— TalentHackers**

This repository contains our exploratory and modeling work for **DataFest 2025**, where the challenge centers on transforming raw, unstructured HR data into **actionable talent intelligence**.



## ðŸŽ¯ Context and Objectives

In the context of HR's digital transformation, we aim to tackle real-world challenges involving talent analytics using AI and data science. The notebook `nuevo.html` focuses on preparing and modeling solutions for the **three main problem statements** posed by the event:

1. **Deduplicate professional profiles**  
   _Identify unique professional profiles across multiple sources._

2. **Predict salary based on resume data**  
   _Estimate salary based on job title, location, and experience._

3. **Predict skills based on role**  
   _Infer required skills for a role using context and historical patterns._

These challenges must be approached with respect to:
- Data duplication and inconsistencies  
- Limited salary information (only ~18% of records have it)  
- Cultural and structural data gaps  
- The need for transparent, justifiable metrics (as per Kaggle guidelines)
